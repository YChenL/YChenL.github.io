<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am currently pursuing the M.S. degreer at Huaqiao University (Supervisor: Xiaodan Lin). I've received the bachelor degree from FuZhou University, in 2020.</p>

<p>My research interests mainly include deep generative models, image processing, speech processing, multi-model learning, and representation learning.</p>
